# üìã Deployment Checklist - Ezii Studio

Use this checklist to ensure smooth deployment of both web and mobile versions.

## üåê Web App Deployment

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Test all features locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Fix all linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Test on different devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Check all API integrations work
- [ ] Test AI assistant functionality

### Deployment Steps (Firebase/Vercel)
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] Configure environment variables in hosting platform
- [ ] Deploy to staging/preview environment first
- [ ] Test staging deployment thoroughly
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify production deployment works
- [ ] Note down the production URL (needed for mobile app)

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test all features in production
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Test from different locations/networks

## üì± Mobile App (Android) Deployment

### Prerequisites Setup
- [ ] Java JDK 17+ installed and configured
- [ ] Android Studio installed
- [ ] Android SDK installed (API 33+)
- [ ] Environment variables set:
  - [ ] `ANDROID_HOME` set correctly
  - [ ] `JAVA_HOME` set correctly
  - [ ] PATH updated with Android tools

### Configuration
- [ ] Web app deployed to production
- [ ] Production URL updated in `capacitor.config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  server: {
    url: 'https://your-production-url.com',
    cleartext: true  // Remove for HTTPS-only
  }
  ```
- [ ] App name finalized in `capacitor.config.ts`
- [ ] Package ID finalized (e.g., `com.eziistudio.app`)
- [ ] App icon added to `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`
- [ ] Splash screen configured (if needed)

### Building Debug APK (for testing)
- [ ] Run: `npm run cap:sync`
- [ ] Open Android Studio: `npm run cap:open:android`
- [ ] Wait for Gradle sync to complete
- [ ] Build APK: `Build` ‚Üí `Build APK(s)`
- [ ] Locate APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Testing Debug APK
- [ ] Install on physical device
- [ ] Test all main features
- [ ] Test on different Android versions (minimum API 22)
- [ ] Check app icon displays correctly
- [ ] Verify splash screen (if configured)
- [ ] Test network connectivity
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Check app permissions work
- [ ] Verify deep links (if any)

### Building Release APK (for Play Store)

#### Keystore Creation (One-time setup)
- [ ] Generate keystore:
  ```bash
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore ezii-studio-release.keystore \
    -alias ezii-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
  ```
- [ ] **BACKUP KEYSTORE SECURELY** (you'll need it for all future updates!)
- [ ] Create `android/keystore.properties`:
  ```properties
  storeFile=../ezii-studio-release.keystore
  storePassword=YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD
  keyAlias=ezii-key
  keyPassword=YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD
  ```
- [ ] Add `keystore.properties` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle`

#### Build Process
- [ ] Update version in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  ```gradle
  versionCode 1  // Increment for each release
  versionName "1.0.0"
  ```
- [ ] Clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
- [ ] Build release: `./gradlew bundleRelease` (for Play Store)
  - Or: `./gradlew assembleRelease` (for APK)
- [ ] Locate output:
  - AAB: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
  - APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Pre-Release Testing
- [ ] Install release APK on multiple devices
- [ ] Test all critical features
- [ ] Verify app connects to production backend
- [ ] Check performance (load times, animations)
- [ ] Test on slow network conditions
- [ ] Verify no debug logs/data visible

## üöÄ Google Play Store Submission
