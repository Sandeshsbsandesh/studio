# 🗺️ Google Business Profile Setup Guide
## CRITICAL for "Near Me" Search Rankings

---

## ⚠️ Why This is THE Most Important Step

**Without a Google Business Profile, you will NOT appear in:**
- ❌ "Electrician near me" searches
- ❌ Google Maps results
- ❌ The "Local Pack" (top 3 results with map)
- ❌ Google's local search features

**With a properly optimized Google Business Profile:**
- ✅ Appear in Map Pack (top 3 local results)
- ✅ Show up in "near me" searches
- ✅ Display business hours, phone, reviews
- ✅ Get direct calls and direction requests
- ✅ Build trust with verified badge

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Google Business Profile

1. **Go to:** https://business.google.com
2. **Click:** "Manage now" or "Add your business"
3. **Sign in** with your Google account (use a company email)

---

### Step 2: Enter Business Information

#### Business Name
```
UrbanEzii
```
**Tips:**
- Use your exact brand name
- DON'T add keywords (e.g., "UrbanEzii Best Electricians" = ❌)
- Must match your website and legal documents

---

#### Business Category (CRITICAL!)

**Primary Category:** Choose ONE of these:
- Service establishment
- Home improvement service
- Business to business service

**Additional Categories:** Add up to 9 more
- Electrician
- Plumber
- House cleaning service
- Handyman
- HVAC contractor
- Painting service
- Moving and storage service

**Why This Matters:**
Google uses categories to match searches. "Electrician near me" → shows businesses with "Electrician" category.

---

#### Business Address

**If you have a physical office:**
```
[Your Office Address]
[Area], Bangalore - [Pincode]
Karnataka, India
```

**If you're service-based without office visits:**
- ✅ Check "I deliver goods and services to my customers"
- ✅ Hide your address (customers don't visit)
- ✅ Define service area (next step)

---

#### Service Area

**IMPORTANT:** Define where you serve

**Option 1: By City/Area**
- Bangalore
- + Add up to 20 specific areas:
  - Koramangala
  - Whitefield
  - Indiranagar
  - HSR Layout
  - Marathahalli
  - Electronic City
  - (Add all areas you serve)

**Option 2: By Radius**
- "Within 25 km of Bangalore"

**Pro Tip:** Be specific! The more areas you list, the more searches you appear in.

---

#### Phone Number

**Format:**
```
+91-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Should be answered during business hours
- ✅ Best if it's a local Bangalore number
- ✅ Enable call tracking (Google provides this)
- ✅ Will show "Call" button in search results

**Pro Tip:** Google tracks calls from your profile. This proves your business is active and boosts rankings.

---

#### Website

```
https://urbanezii.com
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Must be your actual website
- ✅ Should work on mobile
- ✅ Should load fast (under 3 seconds)

---

#### Business Hours

**Recommended for Service Business:**
```
Monday:    8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Tuesday:   8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Thursday:  8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Friday:    8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Saturday:  8:00 AM – 10:00 PM
Sunday:    9:00 AM – 6:00 PM
```

**Special Hours:**
- ✅ Add holiday hours if different
- ✅ Update during festivals
- ✅ Mark if 24/7 emergency service available

**Pro Tip:** Longer hours = more opportunities to appear in searches during those times.

---

### Step 3: Verification

**Google will verify your business via:**

**Option 1: Postcard (Most Common)**
- Takes 5-7 business days
- Google sends a postcard with verification code
- Enter code in your dashboard

**Option 2: Phone (Sometimes Available)**
- Instant verification
- Google calls your business number
- Enter code they provide

**Option 3: Email (Rare)**
- Only if you have Google Workspace
- Verification link sent to email

**What to Do:**
1. Choose verification method
2. Wait for verification
3. Enter code when received
4. ✅ You're verified!

**⚠️ Don't skip this!** Unverified profiles don't rank well.

---
