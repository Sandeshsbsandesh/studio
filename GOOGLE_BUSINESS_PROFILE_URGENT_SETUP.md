# 🚨 URGENT: Google Business Profile Setup
## **THIS IS THE #1 REASON YOU'RE NOT RANKING FOR "ELECTRICIAN NEAR ME"**

---

## ⚠️ **Why This Is CRITICAL**

**Without a Google Business Profile (GBP), you will NOT appear in:**
- ❌ "Electrician near me" searches
- ❌ Google Maps results  
- ❌ The "Local Pack" (top 3 results with map)
- ❌ Any local search features

**With a properly optimized GBP:**
- ✅ Appear in Map Pack (top 3 local results)
- ✅ Show up in "near me" searches within 1-2 weeks
- ✅ Display business hours, phone, reviews directly in search
- ✅ Get direct calls and direction requests
- ✅ Build trust with verified badge

**This is MORE important than your website for local searches!**

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Setup (Do This TODAY - 30 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Go to Google Business Profile**

1. Visit: **https://business.google.com**
2. Click **"Manage now"** or **"Add your business"**
3. Sign in with your Google account (use: `sandeshsb0219@gmail.com` or company email)

---

### **Step 2: Enter Business Information**

#### **Business Name**
```
UrbanEzii
```
**⚠️ CRITICAL:** 
- Use EXACT brand name (UrbanEzii)
- DO NOT add keywords like "UrbanEzii Best Electricians" (Google will reject)
- Must match your website and legal documents

#### **Business Category (MOST IMPORTANT!)**

**Primary Category:** Choose ONE:
- ✅ **Service establishment** (BEST for multi-service platforms)
- OR **Home improvement service**
- OR **Business to business service**

**Additional Categories (Add up to 9 more):**
1. Electrician
2. Plumber
3. House cleaning service
4. Handyman
5. HVAC contractor
6. Painting service
7. Moving and storage service
8. Appliance repair service
9. Pest control service

**Why This Matters:**
- Google uses categories to match searches
- "Electrician near me" → shows businesses with "Electrician" category
- You can have multiple categories (up to 10 total)

---

#### **Business Address**

**Option A: If you have a physical office:**
```
[Your Office Address]
[Area], Bangalore - [Pincode]
Karnataka, India
```

**Option B: If you're service-based (NO office visits):**
- ✅ Check **"I deliver goods and services to my customers"**
- ✅ Check **"Hide my address"** (customers don't visit)
- ✅ Define service area (next step)

---

- More areas = more visibility

---

#### **Phone Number**

**Use your business phone number:**
- Format: `+91-XXXXXXXXXX`
- Must be reachable (Google may call to verify)
- Use the SAME number everywhere (website, directories, social media)

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Update the placeholder `+91-XXXXXXXXXX` in your code!

---

#### **Website**

```
https://urbanezii.com
```

---

#### **Business Hours**
