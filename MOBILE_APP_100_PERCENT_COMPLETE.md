## 🔥 KEY FEATURES

### ✅ Firebase Integration (100%)
- **Collections Used:**
  - `customers/{uid}` - Customer profiles
  - `providers/{uid}` - Provider profiles  
  - `bookings/{id}` - All bookings

- **Queries:**
  - Customer bookings: `where('customerPhone', '==', phone)`
  - Provider bookings: `where('providerId', '==', uid)`
  - Providers by service: Multi-field checks (serviceCategories, services, category)

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Booking status changes (Accept/Reject/Complete)
  - Stats refresh on provider dashboard
  - Bookings list refresh after actions

### ✅ Booking Data Structure (Web App Compatible):
```javascript
{
  providerId: string,
  providerName: string,
  customerName: string,
  customerPhone: string,
  serviceType: string,
  date: Timestamp,
  timeSlot: string,
  address: string,
  phone: string,
  notes: string,
  amount: number,
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
}
```

### ✅ Provider Query Logic (EXACT Web App):
```javascript
// 3 checks for backward compatibility:
1. serviceCategories array includes category (new structure)
2. services array has item with matching category (onboarded)
3. category field matches (old structure)

// Filters:
- active !== false
- Case-insensitive matching
```

### ✅ Role-Based Routing (100%)
```javascript
loadUserData():
  1. Check providers/{uid} first
  2. If exists → userType = 'provider' → provider-dashboard
  3. Else check customers/{uid}
  4. If exists → userType = 'customer' → home
  5. Store in localStorage
```
