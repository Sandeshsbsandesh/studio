## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Firebase Collections Used:
- `customers/{uid}` - Customer profiles
- `providers/{uid}` - Provider profiles  
- `bookings/{id}` - All bookings

### Booking Data Structure (Matches Web App):
```javascript
{
  providerId: string,
  providerName: string,
  customerName: string,
  customerPhone: string,
  serviceType: string,
  date: Timestamp,
  timeSlot: string,
  address: string,
  phone: string,
  notes: string,
  amount: number,
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
}
```

### Provider Query Logic (EXACT Web App):
```javascript
// Checks 3 structures:
1. serviceCategories array (new structure)
2. services array (newly onboarded providers)
3. category field (old structure)

// Filters:
- active !== false
- Case-insensitive matching
```
