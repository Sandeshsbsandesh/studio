# Mobile App Build Status

## ✅ COMPLETED (460 lines)

### Core Foundation
- ✅ Firebase initialization with correct config
- ✅ App state management (currentUser, currentScreen, etc.)
- ✅ User data loading (EXACT web app logic - customers first, then providers)
- ✅ Screen management system
- ✅ Services configuration (hardcoded as required)

### Screens Built
- ✅ Loading screen with animated logo
- ✅ Login screen with password toggle
- ✅ Signup screen with role selection

### Handlers Implemented
- ✅ Login handler (Firebase auth)
- ✅ Signup handler (saves to correct collection)
- ✅ Password visibility toggles
- ✅ Form validation

## ⏳ REMAINING TO BUILD (~1000 lines)

### Customer Screens (500 lines)
1. **Home Screen** - Services grid, location, bottom nav
2. **Services List** - Search, filter
3. **Service Detail** - Provider listings from Firebase
4. **Booking Form** - Date/time picker, address, notes
5. **Customer Bookings** - List with status filtering
6. **Customer Profile** - User info, logout

### Provider Screens (300 lines)
1. **Provider Dashboard** - Stats from Firebase
2. **Provider Bookings** - Manage jobs
3. **Provider Services** - Service management
4. **Provider Profile** - Business details

### Helpers & Navigation (200 lines)
- Bottom navigation (customer/provider specific)
- Firebase provider fetching (with services array check)
- Firebase booking creation
- Firebase bookings query
- Location services
- Toast notifications
- Error handling

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

The mobile app foundation is solid and follows web app patterns exactly:
- ✅ Same Firebase config
- ✅ Same authentication flow
- ✅ Same userType logic (not userRole)
- ✅ Same collection structure

**To complete:**
1. Add remaining screen HTML functions
2. Add event handlers for each screen
3. Add Firebase query functions
4. Add navigation helpers
5. Call `initApp()` at the end

**Estimated**: 8-10 more code additions to complete fully.

## 📱 CURRENT STATE

The app will load but show blank after login because the home/profile screens aren't built yet. Once we add the remaining screens, it will be fully functional.

**Files:**
- `out/mobile-app.js` - 460 lines (needs ~1000 more)
- `out/index.html` - Complete ✅
- All synced to Android project ✅
